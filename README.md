# Prototype
Our prototype is under the Final Prototype Page.
In case the link doesn't open to the final prototype, you can navigate between the CJM, Wireframe, and the Final Prototype through the icon on the left side.
The link provided is of the Figma board, you can also view it in presentation mode to interact with the actual prototype.
Some preferences have been selected by default based on the customer profile.
Error messages have been implemented throughout the prototype (ordering without enough stars, or trying to order again when its their first time ordering)
